### Autocorrect-NLP
#### *Project Statement:* 
*Autocorrect Application for Sadhguru's Navaratri Blog*

#### *Project Overview:*
*This project aimed to develop an autocorrect application tailored specifically for Sadhguru's blog on Navaratri. By scraping the text data, analyzing word frequencies, creating a word cloud visualization, and implementing an autocorrect function based on text similarity, the application aimed to enhance the accuracy and relevance of words related to Navaratri in the context of Sadhguru's teachings.*

#### *Tools Used:*

*Python: Used as the primary programming language for data manipulation, text processing, and algorithm implementation.*

*textdistance: Python library used for calculating text similarity using the Jaccard distance metric.*

*NumPy: Utilized for mathematical operations and array manipulation.*

*pandas: Used for data manipulation and analysis, including the creation of dataframes.*

*re: Python library used for regular expressions, facilitating text extraction from the blog data.*

*WordCloud: Python library employed for generating a visual representation of the most frequent words in the blog.*

*matplotlib: Used for creating plots and visualizations.*

#### *APIs Used:*

*textdistance API:* 
*Utilized for calculating text similarity using the Jaccard distance metric.*

*WordCloud API:* 
*Employed for generating visual representations of the most frequent words in the blog.*

##### *Conclusion:*
*In conclusion, this project successfully developed an autocorrect application customized for Sadhguru's Navaratri blog. By leveraging textdistance and WordCloud APIs, the application provided accurate word suggestions for input words not present in the original blog. The word cloud visualization offered a concise overview of the blog's content. Through the application of text similarity measures and probability distributions, the autocorrect function improved the accuracy and relevance of Navaratri-related words in alignment with Sadhguru's teachings.*

*The project demonstrated the effective utilization of APIs, showcasing the potential of natural language processing techniques and data analysis in developing practical and useful text processing applications. Further enhancements could include expanding the dataset to include additional Sadhguru blogs, incorporating more advanced text similarity algorithms, and refining the user interface of the autocorrect application. This project highlights the power of technology in facilitating accurate communication and understanding of specific topics in the context of spiritual teachings.*
